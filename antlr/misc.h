   function     Returns pointer to character following separator at

                end of the string a pointer to the null byte at the
                end of the string is returned.

   pStart       Pointer to the starting position of the formal list

                This may be the middle of a longer string, for example
                when looking for the end of formal #3 starting from
                the middle of the complete formal list.

   ppDataType   Returns a pointer to the start of the data type in the
                formal. Example: pointer to "Foo".

   ppSymbol     Returns a pointer to the start of the formal symbol.
                Example: pointer to "f".

   ppEqualSign  Returns a pointer to the equal sign separating the
                formal symbol from the initial value.  If there is
                no "=" then this will be NULL.

   ppValue      Returns a pointer to the initial value part of the
                formal declaration.  Example: pointer to "&farray[1,2]"

   ppSeparator  Returns a pointer to the character which terminated the
                scan.  This should be a pointer to a comma or a null
                byte which terminates the string.

   pNest        Returns the nesting level when a separator was found.
