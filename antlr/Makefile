# SOFTWARE RIGHTS

# We reserve no LEGAL rights to the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool
# Set (PCCTS) -- PCCTS is in the public domain.  An individual or
# company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed with
# PCCTS or the code generated by PCCTS, including the incorporation of
# PCCTS, or its output, into commerical software.
#
# We encourage users to develop software with PCCTS.  However, we do ask
# that credit is given to us for developing PCCTS.  By "credit",
# we mean that if you incorporate our source code into one of your
# programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you
# acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report,
# etc...  If you like PCCTS and have developed a nice tool with the
# output, please mention that you developed it using PCCTS.  In
# addition, we ask that this header remain intact in our source code.
# As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing
# this system and expect to make other tools available as they are
# completed.
